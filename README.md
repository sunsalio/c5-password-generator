The motivation behind this project was to create a user-friendly and secure password generator application. Passwords are a critical aspect of online security, and a strong password generator can help users generate secure and unique passwords with ease.
The project was built to provide a practical solution for users to generate strong and customizable passwords. 
Through building this project, I learned about the importance of user input validation, randomization, and user interface design.
